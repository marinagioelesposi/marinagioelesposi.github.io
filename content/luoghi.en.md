**Duomo of Monreale**</br>
The cathedral of Santa Maria Nuova is the main Catholic place of worship in Monreale, in the metropolitan city of Palermo, the archbishopric of the archdiocese of the same name. Built starting in 1174 by the will of William II d'Altavilla, king of Sicily from 1166 to 1189, it is famous for its rich Byzantine mosaics which decorate its interior.

**The Castle of Solanto**</br>
The Castle of Solanto rises in a splendid position, in the middle between two bays, dominating, with its majestic architecture, the romantic gulf. The name comes from the root of the name Solus comes from the Carthaginian word Selaim which stands for cliff. Built in the Norman period as a defensive bulwark of the adjacent tonnara, the Castle became a sudden fame for having been the refuge of Queen Bianca of Navarre, in her flight from Palermo, at night, to escape the desires of love and power of the count of Modica, Bernardo Cabrera.
